A simple gameboy emulator

Always loved the gameboy, and had some fun moments with it.
thus i am trying to emulate it on my laptop.

Installation instructions:

  IMPORTANT WORKS ONLY ON MACOS SILICON
    unzip the ziped file attached below
    go into the file and run gbemu
    you then have access to 3 buttons "choose file" , "play" and "tetris"
    added tetris so that it can be easily tested if it does not work please use the choose file and use the included tetris.gb and click play.
    if you want to use your own rom click on "choose file" and then click play should start working
